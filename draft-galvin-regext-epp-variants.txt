1.  Introduction

   EPP is defined in [RFC5730].  EPP commands were developed to operate
   on a single object at a time.  This document defines an EPP extension
   allowing clients to learn about and manipulate variant groups of
   objects that have a characteristic that makes them equivalent.

   Similar to EPP, the principal motivation for this extension was to
   provide a standard Internet domain name registration extension for
   use between domain name registrars and domain name registries.  This
   protocol provides a means of interaction between a registrar's
   applications and registry applications.  It is expected that this
   protocol will have additional uses beyond domain name registration.

   As an example, the problem being considered is that spelling is not
   necessarily uniform.  For example, an è and an e may be regarded as
   equivalent in some languages, and as different in others.

   Some registries plan to support this explicitly, with groups of
   variant domains that can only be registered by the same registrant.
   Having the same registrant is most commonly considered essential for
   equivalence, since if the domains are intended to be equivalent then
   the responsibility of maintaining that equivalence must be present.
   This is a specific example of the more general "Same Entity
   Principle", which in this specification is defined to mean that a
   variant group MUST be created, managed, and deleted by the same
   entity.  From a registry perspective the same entity would be
   registrar; from the registrar's perspective the same entity would be
   the registrant.

   This document does not define a variant or a group of variants, i.e.,
   this document does define what makes the domains in the variant group
   equivalent.  A registry policy MUST exist that specifies both that a
   registry supports variant groups and that defines what domains are
   eligible to be a member of a variant group.  This policy MUST be
   agreed between a registry and a registrar.  The policy and the
   establishment of the agreement is outside the scope of this
   specification.

   A common policy expression among domain registries and registrars is
   to define variants in terms of the script or language in use for an
   Internalized Domain Name (IDN).  IDN variants can arise when
   different characters or sequences of characters in an IDN are
   considered equivalent in a particular language or script.  Standard
   Label Generation Rules (LGRs) are used to specify the IDN table that
   establishes the variant relationships.  This common policy is
   presumed and used as an example in this specification.

   With this extension, registering a domain creates a variant group and
   the first domain registered in the group becomes the group's Primary
   Domain.  The creation of the Primary Domain MAY establish rules or
   guidelines regarding the domains that are eligible to be a member of
   the group, e.g., an LGR, an IDN table, and a Primary Domain taken
   together will define a variant group.

   Subsequent domains in the same group can only be registered by the
   same registrar, which asserts that it is acting on behalf of the same
   registrant.  Each domain in a variant group may be the target of any
   EPP command, with the following restrictions.

   *  A <transfer> of any domain in any variant group always acts on the
      entire group.  This is required to ensure that the variant group
      is always registered by the same registrant and managed via the
      same registrar.  Registry policy MAY be impose additional
      restrictions.

   *  The <delete> of a Primary Domain in any variant group always acts
      on the entire group.  This is required to support the option where
      the Primary Domain establishes the rules or guidelines for the
      creation of other domains in the group.

   This extension is backwards compatible with registrars that do not
   support variant groups.  Specifically, this extension supports
   registries that do support variant groups interacting with registrars
   that do not support variant groups.  Registrars that do not support
   variants that attempt to act on a member of a variant group
   inappropriately will receive a compatible error response with which
   they can continue to function.  The compatible error response may not
   provide sufficient detail to fully understand the rejection but will
   be sufficient to ensure continuation of normal operations.

   The remainder of this document describes the specific details.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terms

   Allocated variant: A domain that has been created in the registry,
   and which is tied to an existing primary domain.

   Allocatable variant: A domain that has not been allocated but is
   allocatable (according to the LGR), and which is conceptually tied to
   an existing primary domain.

   Activated variant: An allocated domain that is in the DNS.

   Blocked domain: A domain that cannot be allocated due to its
   disposition value in relation to the primary domain name.

   Disposition Value: While a variant relationship is symmetric it has
   exactly one of two disposition values which are not necessarily
   symmetric.  A variant can be "allocatable" (i.e., available for the
   same entity) or "blocked" (i.e., not available for anybody).

   Exempted domain: A preexisting domain that exists as a stand-alone
   domain, but would be part of a variant group if it were allocated
   now.  Exempted domains may exist with any registrant at any
   registrar.  The exemption stops as soon as at most 1 allocated domain
   remains within a variant group.

   IDN Table: The combined information about what characters (code
   points) are available for domain registration as well as the variant
   relationships between those code points.  IDN tables can be defined
   via RFC3743 or RFC4290 or LGRs (RFC7940).  The latter one SHOULD be
   used as it also allows the formal definition of context rules, which
   is lacking in the former ones.

   Label Generation Rules (LGR): The preferred way of defining IDN
   tables.  Among others, they define the variant relationships as well
   as their disposition values (blocked or allocatable).  The formal
   definition of LGRs can be fond in RFC7940.

   Primary domain: The chronologically first domain in a variant group.
   While the variant relationship is symmetric, its disposition value is
   not.  It can either be blocked or allocatable.  The primary domain
   name therefore partitions the variant group into allocatable variants
   and blocked variants.  In case of variant TLDs, there can be a
   primary domain per TLD.

   Same Entity Principle: A requirement that all domains within a
   variant group either belong to the same entity (i.e., the same
   registrant via the same registrar) or are withheld for that entity.
   No other entity is allowed to activate any domain within the same
   variant group.

   Variant domain: A domain in a variant group which is not a primary
   domain.

   Variant group: An implicit set of domains defined by the Label
   Generation Rule (LGR) of the registry.  The variant relationship is
   symmetric and transitive.  Hence, an arbitrary element of a variant
   set defines the whole set.  This set is not expressed explicitly in
   EPP, because it can be impractically large.  At the time of writing,
   a domain is registered whose variant set would contain 10¹⁵ variants.

   *TODO*: Do we need to differentiate between allocated and activated?

   *TODO*: Does it make any difference, whether a variant has DNS name
   servers or not?

4.  EPP Commands

4.1.  EPP <check> command

   *TODO*: probably better not to have a command extension.  For
   Registrars, it would be difficult to determine the suitable primary
   domain.  Therefore, it is better to not ask them to send it, but
   rather return the appropriate primary domain name in the response.

   This extension defines a new command called the Variant Check Command
   that defines an additional Primary Domain name element for the EPP
   <check> command.

   The command MAY contain an <extension> element, which MUST contain a
   <var:check> element.  The <var:check> element MUST contain one
   <var:primary> element containing the intended primary domain.

C: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
C: <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
C:   <command>
C:     <check>
C:       <domain:check
C:         xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
C:         <domain:name>examplev1.com</domain:name>
C:         <domain:name>examplev1.net</domain:name>
C:         <domain:name>examplev1.xyz</domain:name>
C:       </domain:check>
C:     </check>
C:     <extension>
C:       <var:check xmlns:var="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:variants-1.0">
C:         <var:primary>example.com<var:primary>
C:       </var:check>
C:     </extension>
C:     <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
C:   </command>
C: </epp>

   When the server receives a <check> command from a variant-agnostic
   client and any domain within the checked domain's variant group is
   allocated (or at least one exempted domain within the variant group
   exists) the server MUST NOT include an <extension> element.  Instead,
   its response MUST be available = "false".  The optional reason MAY be
   "Unavailable (except as variant)" to tell the registrar it might be
   available as a variant.

   When the server receives a <check> command from a variant-aware
   client and the checked domain is part of a variant group with at
   least one allocated variant (or exempted domain), its response MUST
   contain an <extension> element, which MUST contain a child
   <var:chkData> element.  The <fee:chkData> element MUST contain a
   <var:cd> element for each object referenced in the client <check>
   command.

   Each <var:cd> (check data) element MUST contain the following child
   elements:

   *  A <var:objID> element, which MUST match an element referenced in
      the client <check> command.

   *  An OPTIONAL <var:primary> element.

   *  A <var:status> element, which explains in more detail the
      availability status of the queried domain.

   Example <check> response:

   S:           <var:status>Blocked</var:status>
   S:         </var:cd>
   S:         <var:cd avail="0">
   S:           <var:objID>example.swiss</var:objID>

   S:       <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:     </trID>
   S:   </response>
   S: </epp>

   The EPP <check> command may return five new results:

   *  The domain cannot be provisioned because it is a variant of a
      Primary Domain, and the Primary Domain belongs to a different
      client => NotSameEntity

   *  The domain cannot be provisioned because its disposition value is
      blocked. => Blocked

   *  The domain cannot be provisioned because it is a variant of at
      least one exempted domain. => Exempted

   *  The domain cannot be provisioned because it is a variant in a
      group that is currently being transferred to a different
      registrar. => PendingTransfer

   *  Additional custom value that may be used for server peculiarities.
      => Custom

5.  EPP <info> command

   For variant-agnostic clients there is no change to the standard
   behaviour.  The response contains the actual data of the domain,
   independent of the fact whether it is a variant or not, in addition
   to the following:

   *  if the variant-agnostic registrar is inquiring about a non-
      allocated variant, the response SHOULD be the same as the
      registrar inquiring about a reserved name.  If you don't have a
      policy, suggest a policy.

   *TODO*: XML example of response?

   For variant-aware clients, the EPP <info> command is not extended,
   but its response is extended if the <info> command concerns a variant
   domain, i.e., at least two domains within a variant group have been
   activated.  The response then always MUST include all primary domain
   names across all activated variant TLDs.  Optionally the response may
   include the list of all activated variants (across all variant TLDs).

   In case a Primary Domain name is queried in the <info> command, the
   list of activated variants within the same TLD MUST be returned.

   In other words: * If you ask about a primary domain name * you MUST
   return all primary labels in all variant TLDs * you MUST return all
   activated variants in that TLD * you MAY return all activated
   variants in all variant TLDs

   *  if you ask about a variant domain

      -  you MUST return the primary label for that variant

      -  you MUST return all primary labels in all variant TLDs

      -  you MAY return all activated variants in that TLD

      -  you MAY return all activated variants in all variant TLDs

   The main part of the response MUST contain the actual data of the
   queried domain name (contacts, hosts, status values, etc.)

   *TODO*: check whether EPP spec says anything about the alignment of
   check and info.

6.  EPP <transfer> command

   If a variant-agnostic client initiates a transfer-in of a variant
   domain, i.e., at least two domains in a variant group have been
   activated, the transfer request MUST be denied using 2305 "Object
   status prohibits operation".

   *TODO*: xml example

   If a variant-aware client initiates a transfer-in of a variant
   domain, i.e., at least two domains in a variant group have been
   activated, the transfer request MUST include an extension specifying
   the Primary Domain for the indicated variant domain, including if the
   Primary Domain is the domain indicated in the transfer-in.  If the
   extension is not present the transfer request MUST be denied using
   2003 "Required parameter missing".

   The <transfer> response is extended MUST include the complete group
   of all activated variants formed by combining all variant groups from
   all variant TLDs.

   *TODO*: It must be ensured that the poll message to the losing
   registrar also contains the full list of domains that will be
   transferred together with the primary domain.

   *TODO*: xml example

7.  EPP <create> command

   The EPP <create> command's standard task is to provision a new
   domain.  If the domain to be created is part of a variant group, the
   command MUST be rejected as follows.

   *  If the client is variant-agnostic, the response SHOULD be the same
      as if the domain to be created is reserved.

   *  If the client is variant-aware, the response MUST indicate that it
      is an inappropriate use of the command.

   The <create> MUST only be used to create the Primary Domain.  The
   task of converting an allocatable domain into an allocated domain
   MUST be performed using the <update> command.

   If a client initiates the creation of a domain that does not exist
   and is not a member of any variant group, then the following actions
   are REQUIRED.

   *  If the create is otherwise permitted and the domain could be a
      Primary Domain, the server MUST ensure that all eligible members
      of the variant group are prevented from creation or allocation
      until such time as the domain is expressly indicated by the client
      to be a Primary Domain.

   *  The server MUST act on the create and respond to the client as if
      the domain is a new domain.

   __ TODO__: make clear that registering the first domain within any
   variant group must not be rejected.  The rejection only happens if at
   least one other domain of that variant group already exists.

   The EPP <create> command may have five new errors, as described in
   the <check> section above.

   *TODO*: check alignment of the new error codes

8.  EPP <update> command

   The EPP <update> command is extended to cover two new tasks:

   *  Activating a variant domain in an existing variant group

   *  Converting an Exempted Domain into a Primary Domain and optionally
      converting other Exempted Domains that are eligible to be in the
      variant group of the stated Primary Domain to be activated domains
      of the variant group.

   This extended <update> is not valid for use by a variant-agnostic
   client.  Any use by a variant-agnostic client MUST be rejected.

   This rest of this section specifies behavior when variant-aware
   servers and clients are interacting.

   When a client wishes to provision a new domain in a variant group, it
   uses the <update> command rather than the <create> command.  This
   informs the server that the client understands that the task is to
   provision a variant domain rather than a new domain, and asserts that
   the two domains belong to the same registrant.

   The <update> command MUST specify the domain to be activated and
   include an element specifying the Primary Domain that identifies the
   correct variant group for the domain.

   Note that depending on registry policy, the variant domain may share
   attributes with the Primary Domain, e.g., nameservers.  A registry
   policy MAY specify rules or guidelines for the set of elements
   required or permitted for a variant domain according to the Primary
   Domain.

   *TODO*: xml example

   If a client wishes to convert an exempted domain into a member of a
   variant group as an allocated variant, it issues an <update> command
   including and element with both the Primary Domain and separately the
   list of exempted domains, which the client thereby asserts belong to
   the same registrant.  Note that the client MUST include all related
   exempted domains in the list or the server MUST reject the command.
   The response MUST include the complete list of exempted domains for
   the client.

   *TODO*: xml example

9.  EPP <delete> command

   If a variant-agnostic client issues a <delete> command there is no
   change from the standard functionality.

   If a variant-aware client issues a <delete> command, the command is
   extended to REQUIRE the client to include an extension indicating the
   Primary Domain of the domain being deleted, which the client thereby
   asserts that both domains belong to the same registrant.  If a
   Primary Domain is being deleted then the same domain name MUST be
   specified in the extension.

   If a Primary Domain is to be deleted, the <delete> command is
   extended to include the deletion of all variant domains in all
   variant groups in all Variant TLDs.  The response MUST include a list
   of all the allocated domains in all variant groups that were deleted.

   *TODO*: xml example

10.  EPP renew command

   The EPP renew command is not extended.

   The server MAY reject renewals while a variant group is being
   transferred.

11.  EPP <transfer> query command

   The EPP <transfer> query command is not extended.

   Note that because variant groups are transferred as a group, the
   result of the a <transfer> query command is necessarily the same for
   all domains in a group.  Therefore, the result of <transfer> query
   command for any domain in a variant group applies to all domains in
   the group.

12.  Result codes

   The following additional result codes are defined:

   23x1: Change impossible because of a transfer in progress.

   23x2: Change impossible because something is not a variant.

   This error code is used when a change presupposes that two domains
   belong to the same variant group, but the EPP server's implementation
   disagrees.

   23x3: Change impossible due to invalid primary domain

   This error code is used when the primary domain specified in the
   command is not registered, or is not registered via this registrar.

   23x4: Change impossible due to unspecified primary domain

   This error code is used when a command needs to specify a primary
   domain, and does not.

   23x5: Specified domain is exempted

   This error code is used when a domain specifies a primary domain, and
   the change is impossible because the specified domain is exempted
   instead.

   23x6: Specified domain is allocatable, but not by you.

   This result code is used when a domain is a member of a variant set,
   and the command did not refer to the primary domain.

13.  Acknowledgements

   The design of this extension is almost completely based on work done
   by and decisions made by the [EPDP] committee, which was reviewed by
   a small technical design team chaired by James Galvin.  Members of
   this team included Dennis Tan, Rick Wilhelm, Edmon Chung, and
   Jennifer Chung.  This text (in RFC format) was initially written by
   Arnt Gulbrandsen based on a conference presentation by James Galvin.

14.  Security Considerations

   If two domains are different according to the DNS rules and identical
   in the eyes of the intended audience, then the audience may be
   confused.  Confusion can always have security-related effects.

   This extension expresses the relationships between variants clearly,
   making it a little more difficult for a would-be impersonator to
   register a variant of another registrant's existing domain.

Appendix A.  Open issues

   Open issue: Assign numbers to the error codes, properly.

   Open issue: Not clear that there are any security considerations here
   — the relationships between the domains may have some, but those
   exist outside EPP, EPP merely describes them.  In Italian, caffe and
   caffè are variants of the same thing, it's not clear that linking
   them in a protocol affects security in any way.

   Open issue: Check how to insert a DS record in a variant domain.

   Open issue: Can a unicode upgrade cause domains to become exempted?
   Yes, I think, and the terminology covers it, but as of now, it's
   difficult for the EPP client to understand the situation.  Extending
   the <info> command would help here, perhaps.

   Open issue: Creating a primary domain now consists of a two-step
   process, <create> and then <update>.  The first step turns all
   variants into blocked domains, the second makes them allocatable.
   It's not clear to me why the two-step process is desirable, compared
   to a one-step process where a <create> command creates a primary
   domain if the variant group contains other domains than that one.
   That needs a couple of sentences of explanation, or else a change.

   Open issue: <Delete> now cascades and deletes many domains.  Should
   it instead turn any variant domains into exempted domains?

   Open issue: Should the <info> of the primary domain also return the
   list of allocated variants?  Probably not — at the moment, this
   extension has the client send a set that the server checks, and the
   server may need to generate a set for checking, but the server does
   not need to generate a list for returning.
